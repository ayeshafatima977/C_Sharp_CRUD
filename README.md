# Purpose of the Project:
Create an application will maintain a dataset of items and allow the user to manipulate that dataset. (i.e. Create,Read,Update and Delete)

## Requirements:
Allow the user to input data of your choice (names, numbers, etc).
Store the data that was entered in an array of length 10.
Allow the user to print out the currently stored data.
Continue to allow the user to enter data until the array is full, and keep the program loop running until exited with a sentinel value.
