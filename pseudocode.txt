##Pseudo Code:

1. Create an array that allows user to enter 10 numbers/items
2. Create another array to store the data with 10 elements
3. Need an another array to print the output :Starting from index 1
if (no.of elements<10) do not display the numbers for items that arenâ€™t populated.
4. Assign and Declare Variables:int[] arr1[10],int[] arr2[10],int[] output[10]
5. Allow the user to enter the data continously loop until list is full
if(no.of elements<10)=>Allow filling untilfull
6. Program exited =>When Sentineal value is entered (Show user what sentineal value to be used to exit program)
Ex: Use Done to notify user 

7.Basic menu to allow user to (1)add an item to data set,(2)allow useer to display/Read item and (3)exit
